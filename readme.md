## Text to Image (t2i) ##

As the title of the app says, it converts text into it's corresponding image.

It's a fun app and let's you create images on the fly.

t2i totally works on the client side (browser) only.

Example use case: You could use t2i to convert your email addresses to images and safely display
them on your webpages. You don't have to hide from spam bots that way.
